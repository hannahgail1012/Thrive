	<h1>Background</h1>
		<p>Having a special interest in plants and the many benefits they have, I am interested in educating myself, and others in ideal plant care. Plants provide clean air, stress relief, beautification of the world around us, and in some cases, nutrients for our bodies. However, while having good intentions to care for our plants, the busyness of life often pushes plant care to the backburner. It is often forgotten, and generalized, leaving plants with low quality life conditions in our care. To change the outlook for our plants, there is a need for individuals to be educated in a realistic, and accessible way to be able to make a sizable impact. The answer is Thrive.</p>

	<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
		<p>This series focuses on the brand, Thrive, providing new and experienced plant owners with simple, and accessible plant care by the use of technology right at your fingertips. Using the aesthetic of clean design, playful typography, and bold, cohesive color, my work aims to craft app design that is welcoming and engaging. Through research on best-practice strategies for plant care and comparing the successes and difficulties seen among my competitors, I molded this with user-friendly app functionality to create the ideal plant care app. Incorporating features like plant care reminders, a plant supply shop, and an interactive blog feature to connect users, Thrive provides the tools needed to perform the best care possible for any plant. Additionally, in using a video ad to present this work, I hope to allow viewers to interact with my work in the gallery to build a connection between what you are seeing and the benefits of using Thrive.</p>
