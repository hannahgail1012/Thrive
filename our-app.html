	<h1>Our App</h1>
	<p>In an effort to make plant care attainable to all users, Thrive utilizes various components for success. Using reminders under the “Care Tracker” program, customers can view what their plants require each day, and can check off each task when completed. The users also have access to detailed care tips about each of their plants under the My Greenhouse screen, allowing them to know their preferences for water, sunlight, and more. If users are wishing to buy new plants, the shop section allows consumers to purchase plants, as well as view informative care information, to allow users to feel that they are getting the best plant for their garden. Consumers can also purchase gardening supplies from the shop section to get a jump start to their plant care journey. Additionally, if users have questions about their plant, or wish to share their gardening experience with others, the Bloom Blog screen offers a social media aspect where consumers can interact with each other within the Thrive app. With these tools used throughout the app, Thrive works to equip users with best-practice strategies to feel confident and encouraged to keep their plant healthy.</p>
